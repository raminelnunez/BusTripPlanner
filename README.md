# TripPlanner
* A personal project where I combined my work from three different solo assignments from MITT.
* The project integrates three different API's (Winnipeg Bus Transit, OpenWeather and Mapbox)
* The user can plan a trip, select an origin and destination, the application will display the instructions for the bus trip 
* and automatically display the current weather and forecast of the selected places.
